#🌾 Garden keeper — Agricultural Data Engineering

##📌 Description

`Garden keeper` is an algorithmic and reliability-focused project in Python centered on mastering exception handling and fault-tolerant data pipelines. The goal is to build a robust agricultural monitoring system that evolves from basic input validation to resilient, production-like data workflows.

This project challenges your ability to manage real-world failure scenarios, protect data integrity through controlled error handling, and design reliable software systems using Python’s built-in and custom exception mechanisms.

## 🛠️ Skills Developed

- **Exception Handling:** Use of `try`, `except`, `finally`, and `raise`.
- **Data Integrity & Validation:** Protecting agricultural data through validation and error control.
- **Software Reliability:** Designing systems that remain stable under failure conditions.
- **Advanced Error Management:** Creating and organizing custom exception hierarchies.
- **Code Quality:** Strict adherence to `flake8` standards and clear, readable structure.
- **System Resilience:** Modeling recovery, cleanup, and continuation after runtime errors.

## 🌳 Project Roadmap
- **ex0: Data Validation Intro** – Input validation and basic exception handling.
- **ex1: Error Classification** – Handling multiple built-in Python error types.
- **ex2: Custom Errors** – Designing domain-specific exception classes.
- **ex3: Cleanup Logic** – Ensuring cleanup with the finally block.
- **ex4: Error Raising** – Detecting invalid states and raising explicit errors.
- **ex5: Garden Management System** – Integrating all error-handling concepts into a unified system.

## ⚙️ Execution

Each exercise is self-contained and must be executed from its respective directory:

```bash
# Example: Running the Garden Management System
python3 ex5/ft_garden_management.py
